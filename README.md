Polymer syntax highlighting for Atom & VS Code!

## Atom

https://atom.io/packages/language-polymer

Designed to look good with both [One Dark](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-syntax) and [Atom Material](https://atom.io/themes/atom-material-syntax).

## VS Code

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jonwolfe.language-polymer

**To Enable**: You have to tell VS Code to associate the Polymer grammar with `.html` files either by the grammar selector in the bottom right corner of the editor or [via the settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/vMarch#_editor) (language name is `polymer`).

Most VS Code themes are pretty plain due to the tokenizer being very lack-luster early on and thus don't highlight much. New themes tend to fair better.

Looks best with: [Material Ocean Next Theme +](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fthiagogv.theme-material-ocean-next-plus).

### History
